# 🏴‍☠️ CTF Writeups

Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) writeup repository.  
Here, I document the challenges I solve, including my thought process, detailed steps, explanation and tools used.


## 📁 Structure

Each CTF event has its own folder, organized as follows:

```
/CTF-Platform/
├── Category/
│   ├── Difficulty/
│   │   ├── Challenge-Writeup.md
```


## ✍️ Writeup Template

Each writeup typically includes:

- Challenge Name, Category, Difficulty and Files Provided
- Initial Analysis
- Detailed Analysis

- Tools Used


## 🙌 Credits

CTF challenges belong to their respective creators. All writeups are authored by me unless stated otherwise.
