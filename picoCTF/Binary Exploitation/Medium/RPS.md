# PicoCTF - RPS

## Challenge Overview
**Title:** RPS  
**Category:** Binary Exploitation  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Files Provided:** game-redacted.c

## Description
Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row. The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here. Connect to the program with netcat: $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52704

## Analysis
This program is an implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  
It wants us to win 5 times in a row against it in order to get the flag.  
The odds of that happening are **(1/3)<sup>5</sup>** or **0.4%** assuming true randomness.  
This means that something else must be going on.

My initial thought was the `rand()`
```c
srand(time(0));
...
int computer_turn = rand() % 3;
```
`rand()` is a pseudo-random number generator.  
It depends on an initial seed.  
For the same seed, `rand()` will produce the exact same series of "predictions".  
Here the program uses the current Epoch time as the seed to create randomness across executions.  

The initial idea was to note the Epoch time I connected to the server (hence the program and seed were initialized) and try to reproduce the predictions locally.  
But after multiple tries, it fell short.

Going back to the code, we find something interesting
```c
if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
  puts("You win! Play again?");
  return true;
}
```
`strstr()` searches for substrings.
```c
char *strstr(const char *__haystack, const char *__needle)
```
It checks if the needle, here `loses[computer_turn]`, is in the haystack, `player_turn`.  
It doesn't check for an exact match of the two strings.

So we can simply enter `rockpaperscissors` 5 times and win.
## Solution

- Enter `rockpaperscissors` 5 times
