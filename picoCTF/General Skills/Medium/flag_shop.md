## Analysis
The program shows us a menu wih some actions
```
Welcome to the flag exchange
We sell flags

1. Check Account Balance

2. Buy Flags

3. Exit
```
The **Buy Flags** option has a submenu:
```
 Enter a menu selection
2
Currently for sale
1. Defintely not the flag Flag
2. 1337 Flag
```
From he source code, we know that option number 2 is the one we want but we don't have enough funds.  
Looking at option 1, we see an input of the number of flags to buy
```c
int number_flags = 0;
fflush(stdin);
scanf("%d", &number_flags);
if(number_flags > 0){
    int total_cost = 0;
    total_cost = 900*number_flags;
    printf("\nThe final cost is: %d\n", total_cost);
    if(total_cost <= account_balance){
        account_balance = account_balance - total_cost;
```
One idea is to **enter** a **negative number** for the number of flags in order to **increase** our **balance**, but negative check prevents us from doing so.  
What we can do is **enter** a **number smaller** than **INT_MIN** so it **overflows** causing an overflow

I will enter **-2147483800**
```
Welcome to the flag exchange

2. Buy Flags

3. Exit

 Enter a menu selection
2
Currently for sale
1. Defintely not the flag Flag
2. 1337 Flag
1
These knockoff Flags cost 900 each, enter desired quantity
-2147483800

The final cost is: -136800

Your current balance after transaction: 137900
```
By entering a **smaller** number than **INT_MIN** we caused an **overflow**, **passed** the `if` statement and **increased** our **balance** due to the **undefined** behaviour caused by overflows.

Now we can bu the actual flag
