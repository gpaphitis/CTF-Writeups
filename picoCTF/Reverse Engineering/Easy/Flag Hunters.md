The ether’s ours to conquer, '''\

[REFRAIN]
We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We’re chasing that victory, and we’ll never quit.
CROWD (Singalong here!);
RETURN

[VERSE1]
Command line wizards, we’re starting it right,
Spawning shells in the terminal, hacking all night.
Scripts and searches, grep through the void,
Every keystroke, we're a cypher's envoy.
Brute force the lock or craft that regex,
Flag on the horizon, what challenge is next?

REFRAIN;

Echoes in memory, packets in trace,
Digging through the remnants to uncover with haste.
Hex and headers, carving out clues,
Resurrect the hidden, it's forensics we choose.
Disk dumps and packet dumps, follow the trail,
Buried deep in the noise, but we will prevail.

REFRAIN;

Binary sorcerers, let’s tear it apart,
Disassemble the code to reveal the dark heart.
From opcode to logic, tracing each line,
Emulate and break it, this key will be mine.
Debugging the maze, and I see through the deceit,
Patch it up right, and watch the lock release.

REFRAIN;

Ciphertext tumbling, breaking the spin,
Feistel or AES, we’re destined to win.
Frequency, padding, primes on the run,
Vigenère, RSA, cracking them for fun.
Shift the letters, matrices fall,
Decrypt that flag and hear the ether call.

REFRAIN;

SQL injection, XSS flow,
Map the backend out, let the database show.
Inspecting each cookie, fiddler in the fight,
Capturing requests, push the payload just right.
HTML's secrets, backdoors unlocked,
In the world wide labyrinth, we’re never lost.

REFRAIN;

Stack's overflowing, breaking the chain,
ROP gadget wizardry, ride it to fame.
Heap spray in silence, memory's plight,
Race the condition, crash it just right.
Shellcode ready, smashing the frame,
Control the instruction, flags call my name.

REFRAIN;

END;

```

## Initial Analysis

The flag is contained in the `secret_intro` string.

```python
secret_intro = \
'''Pico warriors rising, puzzles laid bare,
Solving each challenge with precision and flair.
With unity and skill, flags we deliver,
The ether’s ours to conquer, '''\
+ flag + '\n'
```

Which is then embedded at the start of `song_flag_hunters` string

```python
song_flag_hunters = secret_intro +\
'''

[REFRAIN]
We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
...
```

Further down in the `reader` function we see a while loop which processes the `song_flag_hunters`.  
This contains a part with user input from which we will perform our exploit.



## Detailed Analysis

### While loop
```python
  while not finished and line_count < MAX_LINES:
    line_count += 1
    for line in song_lines[lip].split(';'):
      if line == '' and song_lines[lip] != '':
        continue
      if line == 'REFRAIN':
        song_lines[refrain_return] = 'RETURN ' + str(lip + 1)
        lip = refrain
      elif re.match(r"CROWD.*", line):
        crowd = input('Crowd: ')
        song_lines[lip] = 'Crowd: ' + crowd
        lip += 1
      elif re.match(r"RETURN [0-9]+", line):
        lip = int(line.split()[1])
      elif line == 'END':
        finished = True
      else:
        print(line, flush=True)
        time.sleep(0.5)
        lip += 1
```
In the loop we can see that each line is split on `;`
and checked if each part is a control sequence, like `REFRAIN`.

The `CROWD` section is the only place with user input.  
That's how we will manipulate the program.
```python
elif re.match(r"CROWD.*", line):
        crowd = input('Crowd: ')
        song_lines[lip] = 'Crowd: ' + crowd
        lip += 1
```

Above the `CROWD` section, we see the `REFRAIN` section.  
There, `REFRAIN` is switched with a `RETURN <number>` which contains the line number the next `REFRAIN` will return to.

If we can insert our own `RETURN` statement with line number `0`, it will start printing from the `secret_intro` lyrics
and print the flag.



## Solution

The user input is embedded into the song's lyrics.

This means that `RETURN 0` as our input, will be processed as part of the lyrics and start from the `secret_intro` and print the flag.

However simply entering `RETURN 0` won't work since the whole line processed is `Crowd: RETURN 0`.


In order to separate it from the previous text of the line, we have to enter a `;` at the start
since the loop splits each line on `;` and processes each token individually.

**Final input:** `;RETURN 0`
